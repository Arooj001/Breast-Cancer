# Breast-Cancer
📢 Exciting News! 🎉
I am thrilled to share that I have recently completed a project working with a breast cancer dataset!
In this project, I had the opportunity to apply various techniques and methodologies to gain insights and build a predictive model for breast cancer classification. Here's a brief overview of the key steps I undertook:
🔍 Data Visualization: I started by exploring and visualizing the dataset to gain a better understanding of its structure and characteristics. Visualizations helped me identify potential patterns and relationships within the data.
📏 Standardization and Data Split: To ensure the reliability and integrity of my model, I performed data standardization, which involved scaling and normalizing the features. I also split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
🧠 Building a Neural Network: I constructed a neural network model, carefully designing and configuring its layers to capture the complex relationships within the breast cancer dataset.
⚙️ Model Compilation and Training: I compiled the model by selecting an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. Then, I trained the model on the training data for 10 epochs, allowing it to learn and adapt to the patterns in the dataset.
📈 Model Accuracy Analysis: Throughout the training process, I monitored the model's accuracy on each epoch. Plotting the accuracy over epochs provided valuable insights into how well the model was learning and improving its performance.
💡 Predicting Breast Cancer: After training the model, I utilized it to make predictions on unseen data samples. By applying the argmax function to the prediction probabilities, I successfully converted them into class labels, enabling easier interpretation of the model's output.
